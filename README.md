Handy utilities for racket

Documentation: [axe](http://docs.racket-lang.org/axe/index.html).


# Acknowledgements

* Thanks to [clojure](https://clojure.org/) for inventing a lot of handy
    reader syntaxes (such as "{dic}" and shorthand for lambda) and macros
    (e.g. threading macro).
* Thanks [rackjure](https://github.com/greghendershott/rackjure). This project
  "stoles" several components from rackjure. And I learnt a lot by reading its
  source code.
